        <h3>Favorite Verse</h3>
        Proverbs 31:25-27, 30-31
        <blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=proverbs31&version=ESV"> 
        25 Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come. 26 She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. 27 She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
        <p> 30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. 31 Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.</p><br />
